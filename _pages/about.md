I am a currently a PhD student at the University of Mississipi School of Engineering Department of Computer and Information Science.
              
Previously I was in the Masters programs for Computer Science and for Mathematics. My prior background in undergrad was in Applied Mathematics and for my master's programs I focused on Mathematical and Computational Statistics. My personal academic interest is in predictive modeling and the characterization of uncertainty associated with predictive models. My current work has been focused on Explainability in ML models, especially in limitations of explanatory models, what determines an effective explanation, and how to compare explanations to determine 
algorithm efficacy. Additionally I have a personal interest (and ongoing research) in knowledge location for Large Language Models.
